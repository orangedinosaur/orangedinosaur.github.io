            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3>Information Stored Locally on Your Device</h3>
            <p>Preludio stores all of your personal content locally on your device. This includes:</p>

                <li><strong>Song Library:</strong> Song names, composers, categories, and ratings</li>
                <li><strong>Lesson Notes:</strong> Text entries, photos, and videos you capture during lessons</li>
                <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Settings such as metronome tempo and review mode preferences</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data is stored in a local database on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>

            <h3>Information Sent for Processing (PRO Feature)</h3>
            <p>If you are a PRO subscriber and enable AI summaries, the following data is sent to our AI summary service for processing:</p>

                <li><strong>Entry Metadata:</strong> Creation dates and entry types</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: Photos and videos are NOT sent to our servers—only text content and metadata are transmitted.</p>

            <p>This information is collected anonymously and cannot be used to personally identify you.</p>

            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Provide App Functionality:</strong> Store and manage your practice data, songs, and lesson notes locally on your device</li>
                <li><strong>Generate AI Summaries (PRO):</strong> Process your lesson notes through our AI summary service (hosted on Cloudflare, powered by OpenAI) to create summaries (optional, can be disabled)</li>
                <li><strong>Improve the App:</strong> Analyze anonymous usage patterns to understand which features are most valuable</li>
                <li><strong>Fix Issues:</strong> Identify and resolve bugs, crashes, and technical problems</li>
                <li><strong>Process Purchases:</strong> Facilitate in-app purchases through Apple's App Store</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>

            <h3>Mixpanel (Analytics)</h3>
            <p>We use Mixpanel to collect anonymous usage analytics. Mixpanel receives your anonymous Installation ID and app usage events. For more information, see <a href="https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mixpanel's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

            <h3>Sentry (Error Tracking)</h3>

            <h3>Cloudflare Workers (AI Summaries - PRO Feature Only)</h3>
            <p>For PRO subscribers who enable AI summaries, we operate an AI summary service hosted on Cloudflare Workers. When you request a summary, your lesson note text, tags, and timestamps are sent to our service, which forwards them to OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini for processing. The generated summary is then returned to your device and stored locally.</p>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>This is an optional PRO feature that can be disabled in Settings</li>
                <li>Only text content is sent—photos and videos remain on your device</li>
                <li>Generated summaries are stored locally on your device</li>
                <li>Your lesson data is deleted immediately after processing—we do not retain your lesson content after the summary is generated</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For more information, see <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare's Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

            <h3>Apple (In-App Purchases)</h3>
            <p>Purchases are processed through Apple's App Store. We do not have access to your payment information. Apple's handling of your data is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
